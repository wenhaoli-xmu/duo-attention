## TL;DR
We significantly reduce both pre-filling and decoding memory and latency for long-context LLMs without sacrificing their long-context abilities.

## Abstract
Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges.
Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory.
Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements.
In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens.
In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks, referred to as Streaming Heads, do not require full attention.
Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities.
DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately.
Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention.
Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU.

## Quick Start for DuoAttention
We offer a simple one-click patch to enable DuoAttention optimization on HuggingFace models, including Llama and Mistral. Pretrained retrieval head patterns for five long-context models are available in the `attn_patterns` directory: `Llama-2-7B-32K-Instruct`, `Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k`, `Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-4194k`, `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`, `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`, and `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`. If you'd like to train your own retrieval head patterns, you can use the training script provided in the scripts directory. Below is an example of how to enable DuoAttention on the `Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k` model.


```python
from duo_attn.utils import load_attn_pattern, sparsify_attention_heads
from duo_attn.patch import enable_duo_attention_eval
import transformers
import torch

# Load the model
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "models/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True,
    attn_implementation="eager",
)

# Load the attention pattern
attn_heads, sink_size, recent_size = load_attn_pattern(
    "attn_patterns/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-1048k/lr=0.02-reg=0.05-ctx=1000_32000-multi_passkey10"
)

# Sparsify attention heads
attn_heads, sparsity = sparsify_attention_heads(attn_heads, sparsity=0.5)

# Enable DuoAttention
enable_duo_attention_eval(
    model,
    attn_heads,
    sink_size=64,
    recent_size=256,
)

# Move model to GPU
model = model.cuda()

# Ready for inference!
```

## Demo
After setting up the environment, you can run the following script to execute the W4A8KV4 with DuoAttention demo on the `Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Gradient-4194k` model. The demo is designed to run on a single A100 GPU and supports a context length of up to 3.3 million tokens.

```bash
bash scripts/run_demo.sh
```

## Results 

### Retrieval Head Identification
After preparing the dataset and models, you can run the training script to identify the retrieval heads. For the models we evaluated, the corresponding attention patterns are available in the `attn_patterns` directory.

```bash
bash scripts/run_train.sh
```

### Needle in a Haystack (NIAH)

```bash
bash scripts/run_niah.sh
```

### Efficiency

```bash
bash scripts/run_efficiency.sh
```

- Per-token decoding latency and memory usage of DuoAttention compared to full attention across varying context sizes. DuoAttention uses a 25% retrieval head ratio for Llama-2-7B (MHA) and 50% for Llama-3-8B (GQA). DuoAttention achieves up to 2.45× memory reduction for MHA and 1.65× for GQA models, along with up to 2.13× latency reduction for MHA and 1.5× for GQA models. These reductions approach the inverse of the retrieval head ratios as context length increases. Out-of-memory (OOM) results are linearly extrapolated from measured data.

- Pre-filling latency and memory usage of DuoAttention compared to full attention across varying
pre-filling chunk sizes. DuoAttention uses a 25% retrieval head ratio for Llama-2-7B (MHA), pre-filling a context of 100K tokens, and a 50% ratio for Llama-3-8B (GQA), pre-filling a context of 320K tokens. As the pre-filling chunk size decreases, DuoAttention achieves up to 1.73× latency reduction for MHA and 1.63× for GQA models, with memory reductions up to 2.38× for MHA and 1.53× for GQA models.

- DuoAttention’s decoding memory and latency vs. KV budget with a fixed context length. Memory and latency are reduced linearly when the ratio of retrieval heads is reduced. DuoAttention
achieves up to 2.55× memory reduction for MHA and 1.67× for GQA models, along with up to 2.18× latency reduction for MHA and 1.50× for GQA models.

- Combined with 8-bit weight and 4-bit KV cache quantization, DuoAttention can accommodate 3.3 million tokens on a single A100-80G GPU for the Llama-3-8B model.
